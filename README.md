# Sports Center Courts Reservation System

The Sports Center Courts Reservation System is an API-only web application built with Ruby on Rails that allows customers to reserve sports courts at a sports center. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for interacting with the reservation system.

## Features

- **Court Management**: Administrators can manage courts, including adding new courts, updating court information, and marking courts as active or inactive.
- **Reservation Management**: Customers can view court availability, make reservations for specific dates and times, and manage their reservations (cancel or modify).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Customers can obtain an authentication token and include it in API requests to access protected endpoints, ensuring privacy and security. (Commented out to disable authentication for demo purposes. In a production environment, this line should be uncommented to enforce authentication.)
- **Search and Filtering**: Customers can search for courts based on court type, availability, or specific criteria using appropriate API endpoints.

## Development Environment Setup (Prerequisites)

### Rails Installation (Windows)

First, check if you already have Ruby installed. Open the command prompt and type
```ruby -v```. If Ruby responds, and if it shows a version number at or above 2.2.2,
then type ```gem --version```. If you don't get an error, skip Install Ruby step. Otherwise,
you have to install a fresh Ruby.

#### Install Ruby

If Ruby is not installed, then download an installation package from [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
Follow the download link, and run the resulting installer. This is an exe file rubyinstaller-2.7.1-x-x64.exe and will be installed in a single click.
It's a very small package, and you'll get RubyGems as well along with this package.
Please check the Release Notes for more detail.

*Note: Please use ruby version 2.7.1 for this application.*

#### Install Rails

With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line:

*Note: Please use rails version 6.0.3 for this application.*

```
> gem install rails
> rails -v

# output
> Rails 6.0.3
```
#### Database Install

Database used in this application is PostgreSQL database.
To install PostgreSQL on your computer,
you can download it from the [official site](https://www.postgresql.org/)
or by using the [download link for windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
Once you’re on the right page, click the **Download the installer** link.

After the file has been download start the installation process by clicking on the .exe file.
Continue clicking on Next button of the installer until the password reset page of the **postgres** user.
Chose a password and continue hitting next. After all of those steps you will be able to install postgresql.



### Rails Installation (Linux)

We are installing Ruby On Rails on Linux using rbenv.
It is a lightweight Ruby Version Management Tool.
The rbenv provides an easy installation procedure to manage various versions of Ruby,
and a solid environment for developing Ruby on Rails applications.

Follow the steps given below to install Ruby on Rails using rbenv tool.

#### Install Prerequisite Dependencies

First of all, we have to install git - core and some ruby dependencies that help to install Ruby on Rails.
Use the following command for installing Rails dependencies using yum.

```
$ sudo yum install -y git-core zlib zlib-devel gcc-c++ patch readline readline-devel libyaml-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel make bzip2 autoconf automake libtool bison curl sqlite-devel
```

####  Install rbenv

Now we will install rbenv and set the appropriate environment variables.
Use the following set of commands to get rbenv for git repository.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
$ echo 'export PATH = "$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ exec $SHELL

$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
$ echo 'export PATH = "$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' << ~/.bash_profile
$ exec $SHELL
```

#### Install Ruby

Before installing Ruby, determine which version of Ruby you want to install. We will install Ruby 2.7.1.
Use the following command for installing Ruby.

*Note: Please use ruby version 2.7.1 for this application.*

```
$ rbenv install -v 2.7.1

$ rbenv global 2.2.3
$ ruby -v

# output
$ ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x86_64-linux]
```

Ruby provides a keyword gem for installing the supported dependencies; we call them gems.
If you don't want to install the documentation for Ruby-gems, then use the following command.

```
$ echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
$ gem install bundler
```

#### Install Rails

Use the following command for installing Rails version 6.0.3.

*Note: Please use rails version 6.0.3 for this application.*

```
$ install rails -v 6.0.3
$ rbenv rehash
$ rails -v

# output
$ Rails 6.0.3
```
#### Install JavaScript Runtime

Ruby on Rails framework requires JavaScript Runtime Environment (Node.js) to manage the features of Rails.
Next, we will see how we can use Node.js to manage Asset Pipeline which is a Rails feature.
```
$ sudo yum -y install epel-release
$ sudo yum install nodejs
```

#### Database Install

Database used in this application is PostgreSQL database.
Therefore use the following commands to install PostgreSQL.

```
$ sudo postgresql-setup initdb
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
$ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

Please change the password of the **postgres** user or create new user with
```CREATEDB``` privileges.

## Application Configuration

### Database connection

The database configuration file config/database.yml comes with information about installing the pg gem.
Along with other option settings, you may change if you deviate at any point with your PostgreSQL setup.
Here is the relevant development connection information

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  host: localhost
  user: 'postgres'
  password: 'password'
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: sports_centre_courts_reservation_system_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: sports_centre_courts_reservation_system_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: sports_centre_courts_reservation_system_production
  username: sports_centre_courts_reservation_system_development
  password: <%= ENV['SSD_OAUTH_ASSIGNMENT_ROR_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

For the database use connection I have used the **postgres** user and the password of that user.
You can use any user with ```CREATEDB``` privileges and relevant password. Please change those configuration
before proceeding.

### Database Creation and Migration

Once application is successfully connected to the database server, use this command to create and migrate the database:

```
# This creates a database
$ rails db:create

# This creates tables etc. on the database
$ rails db:migrate

# This add essential data to the sytem
$ rails db:seed
```

### Starting Up the Rails Server

To startup the Rails server, make sure that you are in the root of the application in the terminal and run:

```
$ rails s
```

After server has been started you can go the [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the application.
Before running the server make sure above steps has been completed successfully.
